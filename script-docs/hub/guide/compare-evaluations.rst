Compare evaluations

This section walks you through the process of comparing evaluations.

On the Evaluations page, select at least two evaluations to compare, then click the "Compare" button in the top right corner of the table. The page will display a comparison of the selected evaluations.

First, it shows the key metrics: Correctness and Conformity. Next, it presents a table listing the conversations, which can be filtered by results, such as whether the conversations in both evaluations passed or failed the Correctness and/or Conformity metrics.

Clicking on a conversation will show a detailed comparison.
