Create custom checks
====================

This section guides you through creating custom checks. 

Custom checks are built on top of the built-in checks (Conformity, Correctness, Groundedness and String matching) and can be used to evaluate the quality of your agent's responses. 

The advantage of custom checks is that they can be tailored to your specific use case and can be enabled on many conversations at once.
