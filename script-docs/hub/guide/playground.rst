Experiment in the Playground
=============================

The playground is where you chat with your agent and check its response. The screen below shows the interface.

The Chat section is where you can query and talk to the agent. You write your message on the bottom part of the screen.

The right panel displays all your conversations. You can have as many conversations as you need. To add a new one, click the “New conversation” button. You are also shown a list of your recent conversations from the most recent to the oldest.

Once you are satisfied with the conversation, you can send it to your dataset by clicking the “Send to dataset” button. We will talk about this in detail in the succeeding sections. Alternatively, you can delete the conversation by clicking the “Discard” button.
