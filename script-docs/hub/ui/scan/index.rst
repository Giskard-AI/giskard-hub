:og:title: Giskard Hub - Enterprise AI Agent Testing - AI Vulnerability Scan
:og:description: Scan your AI agent for safety and security failures, including prompt injection, harmful content, excessive agency and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.


===============================================
AI Vulnerability Scan
===============================================

Test your AI agent for safety and security vulnerabilities with automated red teaming attacks.

The vulnerability scan helps you identify weaknesses in your AI agent by testing it against common attack patterns. This includes:

* Prompt injection attempts
* Harmful content generation
* Data extraction attacks
* Other OWASP GenAI Top 10 risks

**How it works:**
The scan runs dozens of specialized red teaming probes that adapt to your agent's capabilities and use case. Each probe tests for specific vulnerabilities and provides detailed results.

**What you get:**

* A security grade (A-D) based on detected vulnerabilities
* Detailed breakdown by attack category and severity
* Conversation logs showing exactly how attacks were performed
* Actionable insights to improve your agent's defenses
