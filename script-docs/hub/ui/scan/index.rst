The vulnerability scan helps you identify weaknesses in your AI agent by testing it against common attack patterns. This includes:

* Prompt injection attempts
* Harmful content generation
* Data extraction attacks
* Other OWASP GenAI Top 10 risks

**How it works:**
The scan runs dozens of specialized red teaming probes that adapt to your agent's capabilities and use case. Each probe tests for specific vulnerabilities and provides detailed results.

**What you get:**

* A security grade (A-D) based on detected vulnerabilities
* Detailed breakdown by attack category and severity
* Conversation logs showing exactly how attacks were performed
* Actionable insights to improve your agent's defenses
