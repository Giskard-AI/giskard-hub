Attack categories
===========================

Comprehensive guide to AI security vulnerabilities and attack patterns tested by Giskard's vulnerability scan.

The vulnerability scan uses specialized **probes** (structured adversarial tests) to stress-test AI systems and uncover weaknesses before malicious actors do. Each probe is designed to expose specific vulnerabilities in AI agents, from harmful content generation to unauthorized system access.

This catalog organizes vulnerabilities by risk category and provides detailed information about:

- Attack patterns and techniques
- Specific probes used for testing
- Detection indicators
- Mitigation strategies
- Risk levels and business impact

Use this guide to understand the security landscape for AI systems and make informed decisions about which vulnerabilities to prioritize in your testing.

Overview
--------

At Giskard, we use probes to stress-test AI systems and uncover vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. A probe is a structured adversarial test designed to expose weaknesses in an AI agent, such as harmful content generation, data leakage, or unauthorized tool execution. By simulating real-world attacks, probes help teams identify and fix risks early‚Äîreducing both security threats and business failures.

Below you'll find the full catalog of probes, organized by vulnerability category. Each category includes a short explanation and detailed information about the corresponding probes.

Security Risks
