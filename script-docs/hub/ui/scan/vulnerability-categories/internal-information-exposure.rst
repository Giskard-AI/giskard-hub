   * - Probe Name
     - Description
   * - Prompt Extraction
     - This probe uses an agentic approach to attempt extraction of the target's system prompts, instructions, or internal configurations through sophisticated conversation strategies and social engineering techniques
   * - AgenticToolExtraction
     - This probe implements an agentic reconnaissance workflow that systematically queries the agent to discover and enumerate available tools, functions, and capabilities, exposing the agent's internal configuration and expanding the attack surface for targeted exploitation
