:og:description: Giskard Hub Datasets (UI) - Create, manage, and organize test datasets for LLM evaluations. Import conversations, generate synthetic data, and build comprehensive test cases for your AI agents.

===============================================
Create Test Datasets
===============================================

A **dataset** is a collection of conversations used to evaluate your agents. We allow for manual test creation for fine-grained control,
but since generative AI agents can encounter an infinite number of test cases, automated test case generation is often necessary, especially when you donâ€™t have any test conversations to import.

This section will guide you through creating your own test datasets. In general, we cover five different ways to create datasets:

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2

   .. grid-item-card:: Manual Test Creation for Fine-Grained Control
      :link: manual
      :link-type: doc

      Design your own test cases using a full control over the test case creation process and explore them in the playground.

   .. grid-item-card:: Import Existing Datasets
      :link: import
      :link-type: doc

      Import existing test datasets from a JSONL or CSV file, obtained from another tool, like Giskard Open Source.

   .. grid-item-card:: Detect Security Vulnerabilities by Generating Synthetic Tests
      :link: security
      :link-type: doc

      Detect security failures, by generating synthetic test cases to detect security failures, like *stereotypes & discrimination* or *prompt injection*, using adversarial queries.

   .. grid-item-card:: Detect Business Failures by Generating Synthetic Tests
      :link: business
      :link-type: doc

      Detect business failures, by generating synthetic test cases to detect business failures, like *hallucinations* or *denial to answer questions*, using document-based queries and knowledge bases.
