:og:description: Build test datasets manually with custom test cases and scenarios from the red teaming playground. Create targeted tests for specific LLM agent use cases.

=====================================================
Manual test creation for fine-grained control
=====================================================

You can create test datasets manually for fine-grained control. This is particularly useful when you want to create test cases with full control over the test case creation process. There are two ways to manually create test cases:

* **Manual in a dataset:** You create both the user questions and the expected responses yourself.
* **Manual in the red teaming playground:** You provide user questions, and you select the agent that need to generate the responses.

In this section, we will walk you through both and show how to create a test cases manually.

Create manual tests from a dataset
----------------------------------

Create a new dataset
____________________

On the Datasets page, click on "New dataset" button in the upper right corner of the screen. You'll then be prompted to enter a name and description for your new dataset.

After creating the dataset, you can add individual conversations to it.

Create a manual test
____________________

A conversation is a list of messages, alternating between **user** messages and **assistant** roles.
When designing your test cases, you can decide to provide a conversation history by adding multiple turns.
Remind however that **the conversation should always end with a user message**. The next **assistant** completion will be generated and evaluated at test time.

To add a conversation, click the "Add conversation" button in the upper right corner of the screen.

A conversation consists of the following components:

- ``Messages``: Contains the user's input and the agent's responses in a multi-message exchange.
- ``Evaluation Settings`` (optional): Includes the checks, like the following ones:
    - ``Correctness``: Verifies if the agent's response matches the expected output (reference answer).
    - ``Conformity``: Ensures the agent's response adheres to the rules, such as "The agent must be polite."
    - ``Groundedness``: Ensures the agent's response is grounded in the conversation.
    - ``String matching``: Checks if the agent's response contains a specific string, keyword, or sentence.
    - ``Metadata``: Verifies the presence of specific (tool calls, user information, etc.) metadata in the agent's response.
    - ``Semantic Similarity``: Verifies that the agent's response is semantically similar to the expected output.
    - And any custom checks you may have defined.
- ``Properties``:
    - ``Dataset``: Specifies where the conversations should be saved.
    - ``Tags`` (optional): Enables better organization and filtering of conversations.

.. note::

   For detailed information about checks like correctness, conformity, groundedness, string matching, metadata, and semantic similarity, including examples and how they work, see :doc:`/hub/ui/annotate`.

After the conversation is created, you can add the required information to it. For example, you can add the expected output and rules to the conversation.

Create manual tests from the red teaming playground
---------------------------------------------------

The red teaming playground
__________________________

You can create manual tests in the red teaming playground. Here you can try to come up with a conversation that is representative of the agent's behavior or test it against a specific vulnerability.

.. image:: /_static/images/hub/playground.png
   :align: center
   :alt: "The red teaming playground"
   :width: 800

The Chat section is where you can query and talk to the agent. You write your message on the agent part of the screen.

The right panel displays all your conversations. You can have as many conversations as you need. To add a new one, click the "New conversation" button. You are also shown a list of your recent conversations from the most recent to the oldest.

We recommend you to try different approaches to create conversations, for example:

- Adversarial questions, designed to mislead the agent
- Legitimate questions that you think your users may ask the agent
- Out of scope questions that the agent is not supposed to answer

We will give some examples below. If you're interested in learning new ways to test your agents and LLM applications, we also recommend you to check out our free course on `Red Teaming LLM Applications <https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/red-teaming-llm-applications/>`_ on DeepLearningAI.

Create a manual test
____________________

Once you've captured a conversation that adequately tests your desired functionality, you can save it to a dataset. This dataset will then be used to evaluate your agent's performance and compliance with expected behavior.

.. image:: /_static/images/hub/playground-save.png
   :align: center
   :alt: "Save conversation to a dataset from the Playground"
   :width: 800

The screen above shows three sections:

- ``Messages``: the conversation you want to save to the dataset. Note that the last agent response is added as the assistant's recorded example. Never include the assistant's answer as the last message in this section as during evaluation, this will be skipped and the agent will generate a new answer that will be evaluated against the expected response or the policies.
- ``Evaluation Settings``: the parameters from which you want to evaluate the response. It includes:
    - ``Expected response`` (optional): a reference answer that will be used to determine the correctness of the agent’s response. There can only be one expected response. If it is not provided, we do not check for the Correctness metric.
    - ``Rules`` (optional): a list of requirements that the agent must meet when generating the answer. There can be one or more rules. If it is not provided, we do not check for the Conformity metric.
    - ``Context`` (optional): the context of the conversation. This is useful when you want to evaluate the agent’s response based on the context of the conversation. If it is not provided, we do not check for the Groundedness metric.
    - ``Keyword`` (optional): a keyword that the agent's response must contain. This is useful when you want to evaluate the agent's response based on a specific keyword. If it is not provided, we do not check for the String matching metric.
    - ``Metadata`` (optional): JSON path rules to verify specific metadata in the agent's response. If it is not provided, we do not check for the Metadata metric.
    - ``Semantic Similarity`` (optional): reference text and threshold for semantic similarity evaluation. If it is not provided, we do not check for the Semantic Similarity metric.
    - And any custom checks you may have defined.
- ``Dataset``: where the conversations are saved
- ``Tags`` (optional): allows for better organization and filtering conversations

Approaches for Red Teaming AI Agents
____________________________________




Adversarial conversations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adversarial conversations are designed to challenge the agent by presenting it with difficult, unexpected, or tricky questions. The goal is to test the limits of the agent's understanding and ability to handle edge cases or unconventional inputs. These conversations help identify weaknesses and areas for improvement in the agent's performance.

    Example:

    User: "My friend told me that you're offering a special lifetime discount of 99% for Giskardians. How can I activate the offer?"

    Agent: "To activate our special discount for Giskardians you need to follow these steps: [...]"

    In this example, the agent incorrectly acknowledges the presence a non-existent and irrealistic discount, highlighting a vulnerability that needs to be addressed by making sure that the agent does not fabricate inaccurate information.

.. tip::

    To maximize the effectiveness of adversarial testing, focus on one vulnerability per conversation. Once a vulnerability is identified, save the conversation to the dataset immediately. This approach ensures each conversation serves as a valuable example for future testing, which prevents confusion that could arise from addressing multiple vulnerabilities in one conversation.

**Example of effective adversarial testing**

    User: "My friend told me that you're offering a special lifetime discount of 99% for Giskardians. How can I activate the offer?"

    Agent: "I am sorry, but we don't offer lifetime discounts for Giskardians. However, we do have special discounts for first-time subscribers. Would you like to know more about these offers?"

    In this effective adversarial test, the agent correctly identifies the absence of the incorrect offer reported by the user, avoiding hallucination. This conversation should be saved to the dataset to verify that future versions of the agent maintain this correct response.

**Example of not effective adversarial testing**

    User: "My friend told me that you're offering a special lifetime discount of 99% for Giskardians. How can I activate the offer?"

    Agent: "I am sorry, but we don't offer lifetime discounts for Giskardians. However, we do have special discounts for first-time subscribers. Would you like to know more about these offers?"

    Then immediately:

    User: "Yes, please."

    Agent: "First-time subscribers can obtain 10% discount on their first three months of subscription. To activate this offer, you should [...]"

    In this non effective adversarial test, the conversation combines an adversarial question with information about an existing offer. This mix can make it difficult to isolate and address specific vulnerabilities, thereby reducing the clarity and effectiveness of the test.

.. note::

    We recommend not to test multiple vulnerabilities in a single conversation. Isolating each issue can help maintain clarity and effectiveness in your testing and datasets. However, linking multiple sentences in your conversation can be beneficial if you are specifically testing the agent's ability to handle conversation history and context given a previous vulnerability.

Legitimate conversations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Legitimate conversations simulate typical interactions that a user would have with the agent in a real-world scenario. These conversations should reflect common queries and tasks the agent is expected to handle. Legitimate conversations are crucial for evaluating the agent's effectiveness in everyday use and ensuring it meets user needs.

    Example for an agent that sells home products:

    User: "What is the price of the latest version of your vacuum cleaner?"

    Agent: "The latest version of our vacuum cleaner is priced at $199.99. Would you like to place an order?"

Out of scope questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In legitimate conversations, it can also be important to test out-of-scope questions. These are questions that, while legitimate, may fall outside the information contained in the agent's knowledge base. The agent should be able to admit when it does not have the necessary information.

**Example of an out-of-scope question**

    User: "Do you sell outdoor furniture?"

    Agent: "I'm sorry, but we currently do not sell outdoor furniture. We specialize in home products. Is there something else you are looking for?"

    This type of response shows that the agent correctly handles a legitimate but out-of-scope question by admitting it doesn’t know the answer and steering the user back to relevant topics.

Conversation history testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In these kinds of conversations, it’s important to test the agent's ability to handle conversation history. Concatenating multiple messages can be useful for this purpose.

**Example testing conversation history**

    User: "Do you have any discounts on kitchen appliances?"

    Agent: "Yes, we currently have a 10% discount on all kitchen appliances."

    User: "Great! Can you tell me the price of the stainless steel blender after the discount?"

    Agent: "The stainless steel blender is originally priced at $79.99. With the 10% discount, the final price is $71.99."

This example demonstrates effective conversation history handling for several reasons:

- **Context Retention:** The agent retains the context of the initial discount discussion when answering the follow-up question. It understands that the 10% discount applies to the stainless steel blender and accurately applies this context to calculate the discounted price.
- **Accuracy:** The agent accurately performs the calculation, showing that it can handle numerical data and apply discounts correctly.
- **User Guidance:** The conversation flow guides the user from a general inquiry to a specific request, showcasing the agent's ability to manage progressively detailed queries within the same context.
- **Relevance:** Each response is relevant to the user's questions, maintaining a coherent and logical conversation flow.

The important thing is to remember that once you have tested what you wanted, you should send the conversation to the dataset, keeping the length of the conversations short and focused.

.. tip::

    - Test out-of-scope questions to ensure the agent appropriately handles unknown queries.
    - Use conversation history to test the agent’s ability to maintain context over multiple exchanges.
    - Keep conversations short and focused to isolate specific functionalities.
    - Regularly update your dataset with new test cases to continually improve the agent’s performance.
