In this section, we will walk you through how to setup projects using the Hub interface.

Create a project
----------------

First, click on the "Settings" icon on the left panel, this page allows you to manage your projects and users (if you have the proper access rights).

In the Projects tab, click on "Create project" button. A modal will appear where you can enter your project's name and description.
