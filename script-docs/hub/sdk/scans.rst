==========================
Launch vulnerability scans
==========================

Security scanning is a critical component of AI agent testing that allows you to automatically probe your models for vulnerabilities and security issues using Giskard Hub's integrated red teaming capabilities.

The Giskard Hub provides a comprehensive scanning system that enables you to:

* **Automated vulnerability detection**: Run scans that automatically test for common AI vulnerabilities
* **Targeted threat assessment**: Focus on specific vulnerability types using tags and filtering
* **Knowledge base integration**: Use domain-specific knowledge to generate more relevant security tests
* **OWASP LLM Top 10 compliance**: Test against industry-standard security classifications
* **CI/CD integration**: Integrate scans into your deployment pipeline

.. note::

    Scans can only be launched with the UI. You can launch a scan from the :doc:`/hub/ui/scan/index` page.
