:og:title: Giskard Hub - Enterprise Agent Testing - Detect Business Failures
:og:description: Generate and manage business logic test cases programmatically. Test compliance, domain-specific scenarios, and business requirements in your LLM agents.

======================================================
Detect business failures by generating synthetic tests
======================================================

Generative AI agents can face an endless variety of real-world scenarios, making it impossible to manually enumerate all possible test cases. Automated, synthetic test case generation is therefore essentialâ€”especially when you lack real user conversations to import as tests. However, a major challenge is to ensure that these synthetic cases are tailored to your business context, rather than being overly generic.

By generating domain-specific synthetic tests, you can proactively identify and address these types of failures before they impact your users or business operations.

.. note::

   As of now, the Giskard Hub SDK does not support the generation of synthetic test cases for business failures but you can use the `Giskard Hub UI </hub/ui/datasets/business>`_ to generate them.
