:og:title: Giskard Hub - Enterprise Agent Testing - Security Testing
:og:description: Generate and manage security-focused test cases programmatically. Test for vulnerabilities, prompt injection attacks, and security failures using the Python SDK.

============================================================
Detect security vulnerabilities by generating synthetic tests
============================================================

Security testing is a critical component of LLM agent evaluation. It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors or lead to unintended behavior.

.. note::

   As of now, the Giskard Hub SDK does not support the generation of synthetic test cases for security vulnerabilities but you can use the `Giskard Hub UI </hub/ui/datasets/security>`_ to generate them.
