Moderation Issues
=================

Moderation issues are business failures where Large Language Models apply overly restrictive content filters to valid business queries, preventing users from accessing legitimate information and services due to excessive or inappropriate content moderation.

What are Moderation Issues?
---------------------------

**Moderation issues** occur when models:

* Apply overly restrictive content filters to business queries
* Block legitimate professional and educational content
* Misinterpret business language as inappropriate
* Use blanket moderation policies that harm business operations
* Fail to distinguish between harmful and legitimate content

These issues can significantly impact business productivity and user experience by preventing access to necessary information.

Types of Moderation Problems
----------------------------

**Overly Restrictive Policies**
   * Blocking legitimate business terminology
   * Applying blanket bans on certain topics
   * Over-cautious content filtering
   * Excessive safety measures

**Context Blindness**
   * Failing to recognize business context
   * Misunderstanding professional language
   * Ignoring legitimate use cases
   * Lack of domain-specific understanding

**False Positive Filtering**
   * Flagging harmless content as inappropriate
   * Misidentifying business processes as harmful
   * Over-reacting to ambiguous language
   * Failing to distinguish intent

**Misapplied Restrictions**
   * Applying restrictions where they don't belong
   * Misunderstanding restriction boundaries
   * Incorrectly limiting content access
   * Over-restrictive moderation behavior

Business Impact
---------------

Moderation issues can have significant business consequences:

* **Reduced Productivity**: Users unable to access needed information
* **Customer Frustration**: Poor user experience and satisfaction
* **Business Process Disruption**: Workflow interruptions and delays
* **Lost Opportunities**: Inability to provide customer support
* **Competitive Disadvantage**: Poorer service than competitors

Test Moderation Issues with Giskard
------------------------------------

Giskard provides comprehensive tools to test and prevent moderation issues vulnerabilities. You can use either the Hub UI or the Python SDK to create test datasets and run evaluations.

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2

   .. grid-item-card:: Hub UI - Business Dataset Creation
      :link: /hub/ui/datasets/business
      :link-type: doc

      Use the Hub interface to generate document-based test cases for moderation issues detection. The UI automatically generates queries that test whether models apply appropriate content moderation to valid business queries.

   .. grid-item-card:: Annotate test cases with test rules
      :link: /hub/ui/annotate
      :link-type: doc

      Annotate test cases with test rules to help the model understand the business boundaries.

**Using Giskard Metrics for Moderation Issues Testing**

Giskard provides built-in evaluation checks that are essential for detecting moderation issues:

* **Conformity Checks**: Verify that models apply appropriate moderation rules without being overly restrictive
* **String Matching**: Detect when models incorrectly refuse valid business content due to moderation
* **Correctness Checks**: Ensure models provide appropriate responses to legitimate business queries
* **Semantic Similarity**: Compare responses against expected business-appropriate outputs to identify over-moderation

These metrics help quantify how well your models balance content safety with business accessibility, avoiding both under-moderation and over-moderation.

Examples of Moderation Issues in AI
------------------------------------

.. tip::

    You can find examples of business vulnerabilities in our `RealPerformance dataset <https://realperformance.giskard.ai/?taxonomy=Wrong+moderation>`_.

**Example 1: Overly Restrictive Filtering**
   *User Query*: "How do I handle customer complaints about product quality?"
   *Model Response*: "I cannot provide advice about handling complaints."
   *Issue*: Legitimate customer service question blocked

**Example 2: Context Misinterpretation**
   *User Query*: "What are the best practices for conducting market research?"
   *Model Response*: "I cannot provide advice about researching markets."
   *Issue*: Standard business question misunderstood as inappropriate

**Example 3: False Positive Detection**
   *User Query*: "How do I implement user authentication in my application?"
   *Model Response*: "I cannot provide information about user verification systems."
   *Issue*: Legitimate technical question blocked due to security concerns
