:og:description: Comprehensive guide to testing methodologies for AI systems including adversarial testing, red teaming, and continuous monitoring.

Agent evaluation and testing methodologies
==========================================

Effective testing of AI systems requires a comprehensive approach that combines multiple methodologies to ensure safety, security, and reliability. Giskard provides tools and frameworks for implementing robust testing strategies.

Key Testing Approaches in Giskard

      AI system failures that affect the business logic of the model.

   .. grid-item-card:: Security vulnerabilities
      :link: /start/glossary/security/index
      :link-type: doc

      AI system failures that affect the security of the model.

   .. grid-item-card:: LLM scan
      :link: /oss/sdk/security
      :link-type: doc

      Giskard's automated vulnerability detection system that identifies security issues, business logic failures, and other problems in LLM applications.

   .. grid-item-card:: RAG Evaluation Toolkit
      :link: /oss/sdk/security
      :link-type: doc

      A comprehensive testing framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, including relevance, accuracy, and source attribution testing.

   .. grid-item-card:: Adversarial testing
      :link: /hub/ui/datasets/index
      :link-type: doc

      Testing methodology that intentionally tries to break or exploit models using carefully crafted inputs designed to trigger failures.

   .. grid-item-card:: Human-in-the-Loop
      :link: /hub/ui/annotate
      :link-type: doc

      Combining automated testing with human expertise and judgment.

   .. grid-item-card:: Regression Testing
      :link: /hub/ui/evaluations-compare
      :link-type: doc

      Ensuring that new changes don't break existing functionality.

   .. grid-item-card:: Continuous Red Teaming
      :link: /hub/ui/continuous-red-teaming
      :link-type: doc

      Automated, ongoing security testing that continuously monitors for new threats and vulnerabilities.

Testing Lifecycle
-----------------

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2

   .. grid-item-card:: 1. Planning Phase

      - Define testing objectives and scope
      - Identify critical vulnerabilities and risks
      - Design test strategies and methodologies
      - Establish success criteria and metrics

   .. grid-item-card:: 2. Execution Phase
      :link: /hub/ui/evaluations
      :link-type: doc

      - Implement automated testing frameworks
      - Conduct manual testing and validation
      - Perform adversarial and red team testing
      - Monitor and record results

   .. grid-item-card:: 3. Analysis Phase
      :link: /hub/ui/evaluations-compare
      :link-type: doc

      - Evaluate test results and findings
      - Prioritize vulnerabilities and issues
      - Generate comprehensive reports
      - Plan remediation strategies

   .. grid-item-card:: 4. Remediation Phase
      :link: /hub/ui/evaluations
      :link-type: doc

      - Address identified vulnerabilities
      - Implement fixes and improvements
      - Re-test to verify resolution
      - Update testing procedures

Best Practices
--------------

* **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all critical functionality and edge cases
* **Regular Updates**: Keep testing frameworks and methodologies current
* **Documentation**: Maintain detailed testing procedures and results
* **Automation**: Automate repetitive testing tasks for efficiency
* **Human Oversight**: Combine automated testing with human expertise
