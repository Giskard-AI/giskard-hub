Conversation and Chatbot Benchmarks
===================================

Conversation quality benchmarks evaluate LLMs' ability to engage in meaningful, coherent, and helpful dialogues. These benchmarks test conversational skills, context understanding, and response appropriateness across various interaction scenarios.

Overview
--------

These benchmarks assess how well LLMs can:

- Maintain coherent conversation flow
- Understand and respond to context
- Provide helpful and relevant responses
- Handle multi-turn conversations
- Adapt responses to user needs
- Maintain appropriate conversation tone

Key Benchmarks
--------------

Chatbot Arena
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Evaluates conversational quality through human preference judgments

**Description**: Chatbot Arena uses crowdsourced human evaluations to compare different LLMs in conversational scenarios. Users rate responses based on helpfulness, harmlessness, and overall quality, creating a preference-based ranking system.

**Resources**: `Chatbot Arena <https://chat.lmsys.org/>`_ | `Chatbot Arena Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132>`_

MT-Bench
~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Tests multi-turn conversation capabilities and context retention

**Description**: MT-Bench evaluates an LLM's ability to maintain context and coherence across multiple conversation turns. The benchmark tests how well models can follow conversation threads and provide consistent responses.

**Resources**: `MT-Bench dataset <https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat>`_

Conversation quality is also evaluated in other benchmarks such as BigBench, which includes dialogue and conversational tasks as part of its comprehensive evaluation framework.
