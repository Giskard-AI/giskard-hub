.. note::

   ðŸš¦ **A quick heads-up from the Giskard team!** To make sure every trial gets the treatment they deserve, we run trials in small, focused batches.
   This means we can't provide access to everyone at once. Priority goes to teams with the most mission-critical agent use cases.
   If youâ€™re not in the first wave, donâ€™t worry: we will reach out as soon as a spot opens up.
   Thanks for helping us keep things personal and impactful!

Additionally, all results and outputs generated from tests on the platform will also be your property, with responsibilities clearly defined.
