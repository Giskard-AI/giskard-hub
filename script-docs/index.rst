Giskard Hub Docs
================

The Giskard Hub is a platform that centralizes the validation process of LLM
applications, empowering product teams to ensure all functional, business &
legal requirements are met, and keeping them in close contact with the
development team to avoid delayed deployment timelines.

The ``giskard_hub`` Python library provides a simple way for developers and data
scientists to manage and evaluate LLM applications in their development workflow
during the prototyping phase and for continuous integration testing.

Read the quick start guide to get up and running with the `giskard_hub` library.
You will learn how execute local evaluations from a notebook, script or CLI, and
synchronize them to the Giskard Hub platform.
