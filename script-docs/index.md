# Welcome to the Giskard Hub's client docs!

The giskard_hub library allows you to interact with the Giskard Hub, a platform that centralizes the validation process
of LLM applications, empowering product teams to ensure all functional, business & legal requirements are met, and
keeping them in close contact with the development team to avoid delayed deployment timelines.

The giskard_hub Python library provides a simple way for developers and data scientists to manage and evaluate LLM
applications in their development workflow during the prototyping phase and for continuous integration testing.

Read the quick start guide to get up and running with the giskard_hub library. You will learn how to download datasets,
upload LLM agent outputs to the Giskard Hub and execute evaluations from a notebook, script or CLI.
