Programming Benchmarks
======================

Programming benchmarks evaluate LLMs' ability to write, debug, and understand code across various programming languages and problem domains. These benchmarks test coding skills, algorithmic thinking, and software development capabilities.

Overview
--------

These benchmarks assess how well LLMs can:

- Generate functional code from specifications
- Debug and fix existing code
- Understand and explain code functionality
- Solve algorithmic problems
- Work with multiple programming languages
- Follow coding best practices and standards

Key Benchmarks
--------------

HumanEval
~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Evaluates code generation capabilities through function completion tasks

**Description**: HumanEval presents LLMs with function signatures and docstrings, asking them to complete the function implementation. The benchmark tests the model's ability to understand requirements and generate working code.

**Resources**: `HumanEval dataset <https://github.com/openai/human-eval>`_ | `HumanEval Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374>`_

MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Programming)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Tests basic Python programming skills and problem-solving abilities

**Description**: MBPP consists of 974 programming problems that test fundamental Python concepts, data structures, and algorithms. The benchmark evaluates both code correctness and solution efficiency.

**Resources**: `MBPP dataset <https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp>`_ | `MBPP Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732>`_

CodeContests
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Evaluates competitive programming and algorithmic problem-solving skills

**Description**: CodeContests presents programming challenges similar to those found in competitive programming competitions. The benchmark test an LLM's ability to solve complex algorithmic problems efficiently.

**Resources**: `CodeContests dataset <https://github.com/deepmind/code_contests>`_ | `CodeContests Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07917>`_

Coding tasks are also included in other benchmarks such as BigBench, which covers various reasoning types including programming and algorithmic problem-solving.
