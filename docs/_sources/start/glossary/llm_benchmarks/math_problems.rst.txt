Mathematical Reasoning Benchmarks
=================================

Mathematical reasoning benchmarks evaluate LLMs' ability to solve mathematical problems, from basic arithmetic to complex calculus and mathematical reasoning. These benchmarks test the model's numerical understanding, problem-solving skills, and ability to apply mathematical concepts.

Overview
--------

These benchmarks assess how well LLMs can:

- Perform basic arithmetic operations
- Solve algebraic equations and inequalities
- Handle calculus and advanced mathematics
- Apply mathematical reasoning to word problems
- Generate step-by-step mathematical solutions
- Verify mathematical correctness

Key Benchmarks
--------------

GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Evaluates step-by-step mathematical problem-solving abilities

**Description**: GSM8K consists of 8,500 grade school math word problems that require multi-step reasoning. The benchmark tests an LLM's ability to break down complex problems into manageable steps and arrive at correct solutions.

**Resources**: `GSM8K dataset <https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math>`_ | `GSM8K Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168>`_

MATH
~~~~~

**Purpose**: Tests mathematical problem-solving across various difficulty levels

**Description**: The MATH benchmark covers mathematics from elementary school through high school, including algebra, geometry, calculus, and statistics. It presents problems in LaTeX format and evaluates both answer correctness and solution quality.

**Resources**: `MATH dataset <https://github.com/hendrycks/math>`_ | `MATH Paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03874>`_

Mathematical reasoning tasks are also included in other benchmarks such as BigBench, which covers various reasoning types including mathematical problem-solving, and MMLU, which tests mathematical knowledge as part of its multi-subject evaluation.
