First, it shows the success rate - the percentage of conversations that the checks passed in each evaluation. It also displays the percentage of each specific check. Next, it presents a table listing the conversations, which can be filtered by results, such as whether the conversations in both evaluations passed or failed the checks.

Clicking on a conversation will show a detailed comparison.
