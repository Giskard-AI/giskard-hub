In this section, we will walk you through how to setup projects, agents and knowledge bases using the SDK.

* **Projects**: Projects are the top-level organizational units in Giskard Hub. They provide a workspace for your team to collaborate on LLM agent testing and evaluation.
* **Agents**: The AI systems, LLMs or agents you want to test and evaluate
* **Knowledge bases**: Domain-specific information sources we can use to test your agents
